# Things to improve, add or completely rewrite


## Global

- Add proper documentation
- Test the JSON generated by QueryParameter and Schema

## Builders

- The `Paths`s could be in a `Set`
- Add Schema to Parameters
- Add parameters, id, requestbody, servers and security to Operation
- Add headers to Response

## Good first issues:

- Improve Errors structure
- Use Record syntax on all the builders
- Since the convert functions aren't exported, we cal rename them all to convert

## CircleCI

- Remove hard-coded version number [i.e. by using a CircleCI environmental variable]
- Add support for CodeCov
