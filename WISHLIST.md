# Things to improve, add or completely rewrite


## Global
 - Remove all warnings
 - Remove Prelude (maybe use Protolude instead?)
 - Add CI
 - Add a Makefile
 - Add documentation
 - Write a proper README

## Builders
 - Improve function names (since the final structures are no longer lens, the names can be improved)
