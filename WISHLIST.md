# Things to improve, add or completely rewrite


## Global

- Add proper documentation


## Builders

- The `Paths`s and `Operation`s could be in a `Set`


## Good first issues:

- Improve Errors structure


## CircleCI

- Remove hard-coded version number [i.e. by using a CircleCI environmental variable]
- Add support for CodeCov
